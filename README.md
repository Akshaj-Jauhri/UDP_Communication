# UDP_Communication
This project develops a program for communication between two computers on a local network using a custom UDP protocol. It enables text and file exchange with fragmenting, error checking, and retries. Users can define fragment size, and nodes can switch between transmitter and receiver roles without restarting, ensuring reliable communication.
